; One copy of Rutba Office on a machine.
;
; electron-builder's installer removes the previous copy in the scope it is
; installing to - per-user, or all-users - and only that one. A copy in the
; other scope (an all-users install from an earlier day beside today's
; per-user one) stayed, and Windows listed two. This runs first, before the
; pages and before that step: it finds every registered copy, per-user and
; per-machine, in whichever directory it went to, and runs that copy's own
; uninstaller silently, keeping the documents and the settings. An entry
; whose uninstaller has gone (the folder deleted by hand) is forgotten
; instead of stopping the install with "Uninstall was not successful". A
; copy that cannot be removed stops the install: the one promise here is
; that it never ends with two.
;
; Included ahead of the template, so the macros are defined before .onInit
; inserts customInit; the helpers used are NSIS's own, since the template's
; (installUtil.nsh) are included after .onInit.
